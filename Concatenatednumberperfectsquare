Given two numbers a and b and the task is to check whether the concatenation of a and b is a perfect square or not.

Input: a = 1, b = 21

Output: 121 = 11 * 11 is a perfect square

Input : a = 100, b = 100
Output :No

100100 is not a perfect square

Pseudo code for the following:

1) String or concatenate the two numbers
2) get its factors 
3) Loop through the list o factors and check if multiplication of any of its factors by itself leads to the concatenated number
4) If the result is true then it is a perfect square else its not

def perfectsquare(x,y)
    z = int(str(x) + str(y))
    # z = int(''.join(str(x) for x in (n1,n2)))
    import math
    d = math.sqrt(z)
    if d*d == z:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

print(perfectsquare(n1,n2))
