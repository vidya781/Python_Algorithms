Given an array of elements, find the unique elements in this array/List

Approach:

If one is using Python, convert the list into set and get the unique elements because set does not permit duplicates. Reconvert the set into a list

L = [9,9,8,7,7,6,6,1]
list(set(L))   # This should give the list containing the unique elements

But suppose we want to go in for a more traditional approach, we have the following:

1) Have an empty list and append the unique ( non duplicate) elements to this list
2) Sort the list first

# Need to see if we get an error because of reducing the length of list, try LC if the error crops up

So [9,9,8,7,7,6,6,1]---> [1,6,6,7,7,8,9,9]----> [1,8]

def getunique(L):
    A = []
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(L)+1)):
            if L[i] != L[j]:
               A.append(L[i]))
    return A                       # If all are duplicates, an empty list will be returned
