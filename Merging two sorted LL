""" Given two sorted Linked Lists, how does one merge them in sorted order?"""

Assume that the size of the lists are m and n , now our task is to merge them

def mergeTwoLists(self, list1, list2):                     # Take 2 arguments amd create a temp variable of Node type
    temp = Node()
    pointer = temp
    while list1!=None and list2!=None:            # list1 is not None and list2 is not None
        if list1.getData()<list2.getData():       # if the first element of list 1 is less than first element of list2, set 
            pointer.setNext(list1)                # the pointer to the next elemt of list 1 and get it via the set and get 
            list1 = list1.getNext()               # methods.
        else:
            pointer.setNext(list2)                # pointer points to the item in list 2 if the above condition does not hold
            list2 = list2.getNext()           # and gets it
        pointer = pointer.getNext()           # pointer points to the next item of the list
    if list1 == None:
        pointer.setNext(list2)                # list1 if it is None, pointer is set to list 2
    else:
        pointer.setNext(list1)
    return temp.getNext()

Time complexity : O(m+n) where m and n are the lengths of the two lists
