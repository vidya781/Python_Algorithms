It is not uncommon to find many websites that have public APIs providing data feeds via JSON or some other format.
There are a couple of methods to access these API's from Python.

To find the last 30 Github issues for pandas on GitHub, one can make a GET HTTP request using the add-on requests library

import requests

url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues'

resp = requests.get(url)
data = resp.json()
data[0]['title']
issues = pd.DataFrame(data,columns=['number','title','labels','state'])
issues

Reading MS Excel files
----------------------
----------------------

Pandas supports reading tabular data stored in Excel 2003 ( and higher) files using either the ExcelFile class or pandas.read_excel function.
Internally these tools use the add-on packages xlrd and openpyxl to read XLS and XLSX files respectively. Its possible to instakll these using pip or conda.

xlsx = pd.ExcelFile('examples/ex1.slsx')
pd.read_excel(xlsx,'Sheet1')
frame = pd.read_excel('examples/ex1.xlsx','Sheet1')
frame

In order to write pandas data to Excel format, one must first create an ExcelWriter, then write data to it using pandas objects to_excel method

writer = pd.ExcelWriter('examples/ex2.xlsx')
frame.to_excel(writer,'Sheet1')
writer.save()

Bypass the Excelwriter thus:

frame.to_excel('examples/ex2.xlsx')
