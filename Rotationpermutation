"""Given a number, we need to transform it into a different number.
If the number is p = 30214 then p(0) = 3, p(1) = 0, etc. Goal is to rotate the elements in the permutation
so that each index i is replaed by the element p(i). After rotation, the number at index 0 will be 1, the element at index 1 will be 3 and so on.

Input:
The second line of the string will be a permutation p, where each character will be an integer between 0 and n-1, inclusive

Output: The output should contain the permutation after the rotation operation has been applied.

Assumptions: 1<=n<=10.All input is valid.

Sample Input 1:
30214
Sample Output 1
13204

Sample Input 2:
1230
Sample Output 2:
3201    """
