One concept that might elude some is 'main' keyword in Python programs. When is it needed and why?

Defining the main function is a necessity to start the execution of the program as it gets executed only when the program is 
run directly and not executed when imported as a module.

Now lets dig deeper into the main function:

In Python, it is not necessary to define or write a main function every time we write a program. The Python functions execute 
from the top down unless a specific function is defined.

We write something called a basic Python main():

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
    if __name__== "__main__" :
main()

It is simple to understand the dynamics of the program. There is a function called main().A conditional 'if' follows that checks 
the value of __main__ , and compares it to the string "__main__" . On evaluation to True, it executes main().Now, on execution, it 
prints "Hello,World!"

Execution Modes

There are two main ways by which one can tell the Python interpreter to execute the code:
a) Execute the Python code directly as a script ( most common way)
b) By importing the necessary code from one Python file to another ( from X import Y_function )

Whatever the mode of execution, Python defines a special variable called __name__ that contains a string.The value of the string
depends on how the code is being executed.

Sometimes we may need access to functions defined in some other file ( while importing ) and this differs from the function defined
in the original module itself which for example could be called original.py

To aid in this distinction, Python has a special built in variable called __name__.This variable gets assigned the string "__main__"
depending on how one runs or executes the script.

If one is running the script directly, Python assigns "__main__" to __name__, ie __name__= "__main__"  ( This will not be exposed 
to the user as it happens in the background)

As a result, one ends up writing the conditional statements as follows:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Logic statements
    
Hence if the conditional statement evaluates to True, it means the .py (Python file) is being run or executed directly.

It is important to understand that if one runs something on the Python shell or terminal, this conditional statement, by default,
happens to be true.

As a result, Python Programmers normally write all their code and add this main line towards the end to better organize their code.

So the __name__ variable helps to check if the file is being run directly or if it has been imported.
