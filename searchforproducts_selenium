The objective of this Python script is to open up a Firefox session ( or whatever browser one chooses) that uses the Selenium WebDriver client library and 
does some operations after the website is hit and some search items are returned . The following shows how this entire process can be automated.

from selenium import webdriver

# create a new Firefox session

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.implicitly_wait(15)
driver.maximize_window()

#navigate to the application home page--lets consider Google
driver.get("http://google.com")

# get the search textbox
search_field.send_keys("headphones")
search_field.clear()

# Get all the anchor elements which have the product names displayed and currently on the result page using 
# find_elements_by_xpath method

products = driver.find_elements_by_xpath("//h2[@class='product-name']/a")

# get the number of anchor elements found

print "Found " + str(len(products)) + "products:"

# iterate through each anchor element and then print the text that is the name of the product

for product in products:
    print product.text
    
# close the browser window

driver.quit()

Modifying the script to accomodate IE

import os
from selenium import webdriver

# get the path of IEDriverServer
dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
ie_driver_path = dir + "\IEDriverServer.exe"

# Create a new IE session

driver = webdriver.Ie(ie_driver_path)
driver.implicitly_wait(15)
driver.maximize_window()

# navigate to the application home page

driver.get("http://google.com")

# get the search textbox
search_field = driver.find_element_by_name("q")
search_field.clear()

#enter search keyword and submit

search_field.send_keys("Phones")
search_field.submit()

# obtain all the anchor elems which have the product names displayed currently on the result page using find_elements_by_xpath method

products = driver.find_elements_by_xpath("//h2[@class='product-name']/a")

# get the number of anchor elements found

print "Found " + str(len(products)) + " products: "

# iterate through each anchor element and print the text that is the name of the product

for product in products:
    print product.text
    
 # close the browser window
 
 driver.quit()
