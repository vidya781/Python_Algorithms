Finding the mode of numbers of a list (Skiena, Pg 139)

(4,6,2,4,3,1) has a mode of 4

L = [4,6,2,4,3,1]

from collections import Counter
data = Counter(L)
data.most_common()   # returns all unique items and their counts
data.most_common(1)   # returns the highest occurring item

Thats the import approach but suppose we want to find a function that would do the needful

Can we have a dictioanry with the frequency of the numbers?

def getmode(L):
    counts = {}
    for item in L:
        counts[item] = counts.get(item,0) + 1
    maxcount = 0
    maxitem = None
    for k,v in counts.items():
        if v > maxcount:
           maxitem = k
           maxcount = v
        if maxcount == 1:
           print("All values only appear once")
        elif counts.values().count(maxcount) > 1:
             print("List has multiple modes")
        else:
             print("Mode of list:"),maxitem
using a LC

def mode(L):
    m = max([L.count(a) for a in L])
    return[x for x in L if L.count(x) == m][0] if m > 1 else None
