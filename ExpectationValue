Expectation value of an array or any group of numbers in probability is the long run average 
value of the repetitions of the experiment it represents.

For example, the expected value in rolling a six sided die is 3.5 as the average of all the numbers that come up in extrememly large number of rolls is close to 3.5.

More correctly, the law of large numbers states hat the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected va;ue as the numbr of repetitions approachs infinity.
This expected value is known as the expectation, mathematical expectation.

{1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0}
Output 3.5

def calc_Expectation(a,n):
    prb = 1/n  # same for every elem
    sum = 0     # calc the overall expectation
    for i in range(0,n):
        sum += (a[i] * prb)
    return float(sum) # returning expectation as the sum

n = 6
a = [1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0]

expect = calc_Expectation(a,n)

print("Expectation of array E(X) is : ", expect)
