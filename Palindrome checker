# How can we use a deque to store a palindrome 

# The trick is to store the characters in the deque like an ordinary queue one by one
# If the reach character is equal to the first character we can say that yes, we may proceed to the next charcater and compare from rear and front
# If not, they are not equal, keep doing this till the middle of the string is reached
