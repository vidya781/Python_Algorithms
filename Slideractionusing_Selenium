The objective of this program is to demonstrate the use of Selenium in order to demonstrate slider action. For this purpsoe we will be using jquery 

The program structure begins by importing some essential libraries and invoking some methods that are vital for this task.

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver import ActionChains
import time
class Sliders():
    def movesliders(self):
        baseUrl = "https://jqueryui.com/slider/"
        driver = webdriver.Firefox()     # as an example, Firefox is chosen but this can vary depending on one's requirements
        driver.maximize_window()        # invoking some methods on the driver
        driver.get(baseUrl)
        driver.implicitly_wait(3)     # If elements are not immediately available, an implicit wait tells web driver to poll the DOM for 
                                          a certain amount of time. Default setting is 0.
        driver.switch_to.frame(0)
        element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "/div[@id='slider']//span")
        time.sleep(2)
        try:
            action = ActionChains.(driver)
            actions.drag_and_drop_by_offset(element,100,0).perform()
            print("Sliding Element Successful")
            time.sleep(2)
        except:
            print("Sliding failed on the element")
 
 cf = Sliders()
 cf.movesliders()
