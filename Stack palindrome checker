"How do we go about solving the palindrome problem using stacks"

Steps in the algorithm

1] Traverse the list till we encounter X as the input element
2] During the traversal push all the elements(until X) on to the stack
3] For the second half of the list, compare each elements content with top of the stack.If they are the same then pop the stack and
go to the next element in the input list
4] If they are not the same then the given string is not a palindrome
5] Continue this until the stack is empty or string is not a palindrome


def isPalindrome(str):
    strStack = Stack()    # initializing a stack
    palindrome = False   # a boolean negative
    for char in str:
        strStack.push(char)
    for char in str:
        if char == strStack.pop()
    else:
        palindrome = False
    return palindrome
    
    print isPalindrome("smadams")
    
# Time complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity is O(n/2) ~~ O(n)
