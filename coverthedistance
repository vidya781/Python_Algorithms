Given a distance dist, count the total number of ways to cover the distance with 1,2 and 3 steps

4 ways are as depicted below:

1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 step
2 step + 1 step
3 step

def count_ways(n):
    count = [0]*(n+1)
    count[0] = 1
    count[1] = 1
    count[2] = 2

    for i in range(3,n+1):
        count[i] = count[i-1] + count[i-2] + count[i-3]

    return count[n]

if __name__ == '__main__':
   print(count_ways(n))
