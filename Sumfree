"""The objective of this program is to generate all possible sums of a given list and check if any of the elemenst of the generated list are present in the original list

A set of integers, X, is said to be sum free if the sum of any two integers
in X is not in X.

More formally,a,b in X (a+b) not in X

Given a set of integers as input determine if it is sum free or not

The first line contains an integer N, 2 <=N<=1000, the number of integers in the set. The second line contains N space separated positive integers

Output: Output should be 1 if the set is sum free, 0 otherwise.

Lets consider a list L = [4,5,1,5,2,8]

We need to get all possible sums:

4+5 5+1 1+5 5+2 2+8
4+1 5+5 1+2 5+8 
4+5 5+2 1+8
4+2 5+8      
4+8   """

L = [4,5,1,5,2,8]

def generatepairs(L):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(L)):
               result.append([L[i],L[j]])
    return result

pairings = generatepairs(L)
print("%d pairings"%len(pairings))
for pair in pairings:
       print(pair)


LOL = [sum(pair) for pair in pairings]
print(LOL)

count = 0
for i in range(0,len(LOL)):
    if LOL[i] in L:
        count += 1
    else:
        pass
print(count)

if count > 0:
    print("Not Sum Free-0")
else:
    print("Sum Free-1")
