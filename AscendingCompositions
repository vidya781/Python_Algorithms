Generating ascending compositions

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 2
1 + 1 + 3
1 + 4
2 + 3
5

An integer partition is an expression of a positive integer n as an unordered collection of positive 
integers. A composition, on the other hand, is an expresssion of n as an ordered collection of positive integers. For example, 1 + 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 1 and 2 + 1 + 1 all represent the same partition of 4. Then, ascending compositions are the compositions of n where all the parts are in ascending (non decreasing) order.
 For example, the ascending compositions of 5 are as above.

def rule_asc(n):
    a = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    k = 1
    a[1] = n
    while k != 0:
       x = a[k-1] + 1
       y = a[k] - 1
       k -= 1
       while x <= y:
           a[k] = x
           y -= x
           k += 1
       a[k] = x + y
       yield a[:k+1]

The above is an iterative solution and is a generator
