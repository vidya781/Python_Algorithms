Check if LCM of array elems is divisible by prime number or not.

int[] a = [10,20,15,25]
k = 3

1) First find the LCM
2) Second check if LCM % k == 0 or not

One could also say that if any of the array elems is divisible by k then the LCM of the array is also divisible by k

def func(a,k,n):
    for i in range(0,n):
        if (a[i] % k == 0):
            return True
    a = [14,27,38,76,84]
    k = 19
    res = func(a,k,5)
    if(res):
       print("true")
    else:
       print("false")
