What are cookies?

Cookies are important for any web applications to store information on the user's computer for a better user experience. Cookies are used
to store user preferences, login information, and various other details of the client.

The Selenium Web driver API provides various methods to manage these cookies during testing. One can read cookie values, add cookies and delete cookies during the test. This can be used to test how the application reacts when the cookies are manipulated.

The following are the methods to manage cookies:

1) add_cookie(cookie_dict)--- method adds a cookie to the current session
2) delete_all_cookies()----method deletes all the cookies from the current session
3) delete_cookie(name)----method deletes a single cookie with the specified name
4) get_cookie(name)---method gets a single cookie by the name and returns the dictionary for the cookie if found, none, if not found
5) get_cookies()---This method gets a set of dictionaries corresponding to cookies from the current session
