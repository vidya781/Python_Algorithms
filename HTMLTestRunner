As a rule of thumb, sending console logs to stakeholders might not be a very effective practice. One will need formatted reports with drill down 
access to finer details.

In this example, we will use HTMLTestRunner. More details at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/HTMLTestRunner

import unittest
import HTMLTestRunner
import os
from searchtests import SearchTests
from homepagetests import HomePageTest

# get the directory path to output report file

dir = os.getcwd()

# get all the tests from SearchProductTest and HomePageTest class

search_tests = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(SearchTests)
home_page_tests = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(HomePageTest)

#create a test suite combining search_test and home_page_test
smoke_tests = unittest.TestSuite([home_page_tests,search_tests])

# Open the report file
outfile = open(dir + "\SmokeTestReport.html","w")

#configure HTMLTestRunner options
runner = HTMLTestRunner.HTMLTestRunner(
                 stream = outfile,
                 title = 'Test Report',
                 description = 'Smoke Tests'
                 )
                 
 # run the suite using HTMLTestRunner
 runner.run(smoke_tests)
