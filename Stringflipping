You are given a string consisting of the letters x and y, such as xyxxxyxyy. 
In addition, you have an operation called flip, which changes a single x to y or vice versa.

Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all x's come before all y's.
In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return 2.

Solution:

def split(string): 
	return [char for char in string]    # return a list of individual characters in a string
	
# Driver code 
string = 'yxxyxyxyy'
print(split(string))      # return the list

splitlist = split(string)

def flip(string):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1,len(string)):
        if splitlist[i-1] == 'y' and splitlist[i]=='x':     # Notice the criteria : only if the char left to its neighbor is y is the flipping taking place and the count being increased
            splitlist[i] == 'x'                             # flip y to x 
            count += 1                                    # increment the count
    return count
print(flip(string))
