Print Right View of a Binary Tree

Given a BT, print Right View of the tree.Right view of a BT is a set of nodes visble 
when tree is visited from the Right Side

     1

  2    3

4   5 6  7
 
           8

The Right View contains all nodes that are last nodes in their levels. If one does Level order traversal then one can print the last nodes at every level

class Node:
    def __init__(self,item):
        self.data = item
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

   # Recursive function to print right view of BT
   # used maxlevel as reference list...only maxlevel[0] is what we want

    def rightviewutil(root,level,maxlevel):
        # Base case
        if root is None:
           return
        # If this is the last node of its level
        if(maxlevel[0] < level):
          print("%d " %(root.data),
          maxlevel[0] = level

        # Recur for right subtree first, then left sub tree
       rightViewUtil(root.right,level+1,maxlevel)
       rightViewUtil(root.left,level+1,maxlevel)

    def rightView(root):
        maxlevel = [0]
        rightViewUtil(root,1,maxlevel)

  # Driver program to test above function
   root = Node(1)
   root.left = Node(2)
   root.right = Node(3)
   root.left.left = Node(4)
   root.left.right = Node(5)
   root.right.left = Node(6)
   root.right.right = Node(7)
   root.right.left.right = Node(8)

   rightView(root)

TC : Function does a simple traversal of the tree, so complexity is O(n)
