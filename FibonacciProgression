The purpose of this script is to introduce the reader to the nuances of good programming practice via a general;ized fibonacci progression.

class FibonacciProgression(Progression):
    """Iterator producing a generalized Fibonacci Progression.""""
    
    def __init__(self,first=0,second=1):
        """Create a new fibonacci progression
        
        first --the first term of the progression  (default 0)
        second --the second term of the progression (default 1)
        
        super().__init__(first).    # start progression at first
        self._prev = second - first.  # fictitious value preceding the first
        
    def _advance(self):
        """Update current value by taking sum of previous two."""
        self._prev,self._current = self._current,self._prev + self._current
