The following program will give a count of A, T, G and C in a DNA Sequence. Part of an ongoing effort for developing sound,
robust algorithms in Bioinformatics.


dna = 'ATTGCATTGCCAAAAATTTTGCC'


def count_of_each(dna):
    list_dna = list(dna)
    count_A = 0
    count_T = 0
    count_G = 0
    count_C = 0
    for item in list_dna:
        if item == 'A':
            count_A += 1
        if item == 'T':
            count_T += 1
        if item == 'G':
            count_G += 1
        else :
            count_C = len(list_dna)-(count_A + count_T + count_G)
    return count_A,count_T,count_G,count_C

print(count_of_each(dna))
